    <h2>Mediterranean Stuffed Zucchini</h2>
    <em>Nice and easy Stuffed Zucchini, Mediterranean style</em>

    <h3> Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>1 extra large zucchini, halved lengthwise</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1 sweet onion, chopped</li>
    <li>1 pound ground lamb</li>
    <li>1½ cup pine nuts</li>
    <li>¼ cup water</li>
    </ul>  

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Use a melon baller to separate and remove seeds and pulp separately from the zucchini, carving out each half and leaving about a half-inch shell. Chop zucchini pulp into pieces about 1/4 inch in diameter. Discard seeds.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes. Add ground lamb; continue to cook and stir until lamb is lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir chopped zucchini into the lamb mixture. Reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer mixture until the zucchini is hot, about 3 minutes. Drain excess grease. Season lamb mixture with coarse salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Remove skillet from heat. Stir tomato sauce, tomatoes, feta cheese, pine nuts, and 1/4 cup mint leaves through the lamb mixture; spoon into the zucchini halves. Put stuffed zucchini halves into a large baking dish. Pour water into the baking dish.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
    </ol>
